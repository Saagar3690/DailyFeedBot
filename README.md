A React Native App that collects all the things I look at - weather, news, soccer stats (Barcelona), commute time, etc. - and puts them into one place for convience and simplicity.

Why I built it:

To save time and get all my information at a glance

To practice my React Native Skills

To Do:

Add User Authentication using Firebase

Add custom input that allows users to set certain information like origin and destination for the commute

Improve the UI
